            <Project title={"HackYourFuture Denmark"} subtitle={"Volunteering"}>
                <p>
                In Oct 2023 I started volunteering as a mentor at  <a href="https://www.hackyourfuture.dk/" target="_blank">HackYourFuture Denmark</a>, a non-profit organization that teaches refugees and asylum seekers how to code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have have always loved learning and teaching, and HackYourFuture is a great opportunity for me to do both while also helping people in need.
                    Since I joined, I have taught students how to code in <span className="badge">Javascript</span>, <span className="badge">SQL</span>, and <span className="badge">React</span> and provided them feedback and guidance on their projects.

            <Project title={"The Danish Redcross Youth"} subtitle={"Volunteering"}>
                <p>
                    My first experience as a volunteer started in <a href="https://www.urk.dk/english" target="_blank">The Danish Red Cross Youth</a> where I was responsible for helping kids age 8 to 18 with their homework.
                    This homework could be anything from math and physics to history and litterature. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It taught me a lot about how to communicate with people of all ages and how to explain difficult topics in simple or creative ways.
                    I also experienced how my teaching style and approach would have a significant effect on the students ability to learn.
                    I found that building trust and keeping the atmostphere light and fun was the best way to get the students to open up and stay engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I decided to stop volunteering at the Red Cross because I moved to the other end of Copenhagen and it was no longer practical for me to continue. ðŸ˜¢

                            My friend and I wrote our thesis in collaboration with Dalux on the topic: <i>Improved Construction and Facility Management using Mixed Reality</i>. 
                            In overly simplified words, we made <a href="https://www.webwise.ie/parents/pokemon-go/" target="_blank">Pokemon Go</a> for the construction industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The construction industry is using digital 3D models to design and plan the construction of buildings. 
                            These models are not only used to visualize the building, but also contain technical specifications to help the construction workers understand how the building should be built.
                            It is therefore crucial that the construction workers have easy access to these models on the construction site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, these 3D models can be huge, sometimes several gigabytes in size. Imagine a 3D model of a hospital with thousands of rooms that contains all details about the pipes, wires, and other technical specifications.
                            We faced two main challenges:
                            <ul>
                                <li>How do we manage such a big files on a small mobile device with limited processing power and wifi signal?</li>
                                <li>How do you visualize such a huge model on a small screen so non-technical people can easily understand and use it?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using <span className="badge">Unity</span> and <span className="badge">C#</span> we managed to develop an app that could overlay the digital model on top of the mobile device's camera. 
                            But to do that we had to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Determine the location of the user by using the camera to build a spatial model of the room the user was in and then identifying the position in the digital model</li>
                                <li>design algorithms to preprocess, compress and organize the data of the 3D models to enable the app to stream the data fast and effienciently</li>
                                <li>write custom code to visualize the 3D graphics and enable the user to select elements to inspect their tehcnical details.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end the project was a great success, we got an A, and the project was later refined into the product <a href="https://www.dalux.com/dalux-field/twinbim/" target="_blank">TwinBIM</a>.
