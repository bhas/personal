              Republica was the first place where I really got to stand on my
              own feet. Beforehand I had mostly worked with a monolithic
              architecture and tools developed inhouse in Dalux. Republica was
              had implemented their APIs as microservices using .NET Core with
              SQL Server and all communication between the services was
              implemented using event queues or API calls. For the UI we used
              React. Everything was managed using Azure DevOps and deployed to
              local Linux servers.

              I started my professional carreer at Dalux where I worked as a
              fullstack developer in a rapidly growing environment. Initially, I
              was mostly solving smaller tasks, but as leadership realised my
              talent I was given more responsibilities and eventually moved on
              to design and implement core systems and guiding junior
              developers.
