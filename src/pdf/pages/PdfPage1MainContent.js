          At Maersk, I played an essential role in the implementation and
          maintenance of our integration between Maersk's platform and
          customers' systems. A significant challenge involved migrating our
          legacy Golang-based integration to a .NET microservice architecture.

          During my time at Republica, I was a member of a small tech team
          responsible for overseeing the internal platform used to manage
          product data and associated assets. When I started, the existing
          codebase was in a poor state and the system was not reliable so our
          first objective was to get it into a reliable state.
